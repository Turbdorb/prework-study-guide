# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
I was motivated to do this to better prepare myself for the bootcamp, and so I have a better chance of achieving my personal goals. I built this project to help me understand the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. It will help myself and others with coding to become a web developer. This helped me learn with practice what the point/use of HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript has for web development.
